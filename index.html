                <h2>About</h2>
                <p id="p1">&emsp;&emsp;Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.</p>

                <ul><li>
                    In the annals of Indian history, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam shines as a luminary figure, not only as the 11th President of India but also as a brilliant scientist whose contributions to the fields of science and space exploration remain unparalleled. Recognized for his exceptional achievements, he was bestowed with the esteemed Bharat Ratna award, an honor reserved for the nation's most distinguished individuals.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam's illustrious journey spanned nearly four decades, during which he served with unwavering dedication at the Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Tragically, on the 27th of July 2015, while delivering a speech in Shillong, he breathed his last, succumbing to a sudden cardiac arrest.</li>
